Complex Networks Notes

Notation:
sum(i,j,k,sum_expr) is sum from j to k with index i over sum_expr
[A^n] is matrix exponentiation: A to the nth power
A^T is matrix transpose of A

A graph G = (V,E) where V:nodes, E:edges,|V|=n,|E| = m

Adjacency matrix:
A:nxn
A_ij = {1 if there exists (j,i) e E
       {0 otherwise
If G is undirected, A_ij = A_ji foreach i,j
Degree of node i is # of edges incident on i
For undirected network/graph, degree of network is:
    -total count of 1s in adjacency matrix:
        sum(i,1,n,sum(i,1,n,A_ij))
density: c = (1/n)sum(1,n,A_i) = (2m/n)
Dense networks: easier to find paths through network but comm btween nodes could interfere more easily
Sparse networks: less contention but finding paths is slower
Find max number of nodes that are directly connected => vertex cover
Find max density (max num edges) => n choose 2 (pick any node, it has n-1 neighbors. Pick another, it has n-2, and so on for all nodes)

Walk: more general than a path
    a series of nodes v_1, v_2, ... , v_i where there exists an edge between v_i,v_i+1 for each i=1...n-1
How many walks of length n are in graph G?
    How many walks of length 2?
        sum(p,1,n,A_ip*A_pj) for each i,j = [A^2]_ij
    How many walks of length 3?
        sum(p,1,n,sum(q,1,n,A_ip*A_pq*A_qj)) i,j = [A^3]_ij
    How many walks of length r?
        [A^r]_ij
    How many cycles of length r that start and end on i
        [A^r]_ii
Tress:
    For any two nodes, there's only one path between
    It's possible to have n-1 edges but fail to have a tree
    Trees are fragile for use with routing: imagine removing one edge from the root to a subtree - that whole subtree is inaccessible!
    However, they are also efficient since there's only one path for each pair of nodes
        Can mitigate the fragility by having nodes remember connections to "siblings"

Directed Networks:
Edges have direction, adjacency matrix is no longer necessarily symmetric
    ex. If our nodes are papers and edges citations
    Cocitation matrix:
        For papers i,j,k:
        i<------k------->j
            c_ij = sum(1,n,k,A_ik*A_jk)
            (Cocitation matrix) C = c_ij foreach(i,j=1...n) = AA^T
    Bibliographic Coupling:
        For papers i,j,k:
        i------->k<-------j
        b_ij = sum(k,1,n,A_ki*A_kj)
        (Bibliographic coupling matrix) B = b_ij foreach(i,j=1...n)
For next time: directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
